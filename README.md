# Constrained wind simulation in a 2D plane

## Summary
 
Matlab code for a conditional/constrained wind simulation in a 2D plane. The coherence function is modelled using the Davenport model. Only one velocity component is simulated at a time. It is possible to generate non-stationary event with time-varying coherence, but the simulation time will be significantly increased.
